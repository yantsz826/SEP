The goal of this project was to create a web portal which users could log into to get specific details about each of their invoices and determine their status. 

Once the files have been set up against localhost or the IDE of the users choice, the user will need to create an administrator user in the database before being able to use the web portal. The administrator will be able to create users as they fit, but they must be created in the database first.

These files were developed and tested against an Oracle XE database running off a Glassfish server.

Files included in package:

Scripts for creating Oracle tables are included under:
DB Scripts\

Java Servlet files are stored under:
src\java\com\webportal\

Web files (JSP, CSS, JS) are stored under:
web\

jQuery plugins used in development are stored under:
web\boostrap-3.3.6-dist
web\DataTables
